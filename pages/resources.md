There's lot of bad information when it comes to Machine Learning (lots of disinformation!), so I've decided to point out some good resources! All of the courses outlined have video lectures.

- [Stanford's course at coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)
- [A beautiful book on neural networks](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) - expect backpropagation which he overcomplicated!
- [Stanford's CS229](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229)
- [Stanford's CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
- [Hinton's course at Coursera on Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/home/welcome)
