### What is Project Baby Step?

Project Baby Step is a project aiming to create a superb gender classifier. It is a preliminary tiny project, working my way up to a **far** more ambitious project that I have in mind for quite some time now.

### Results

As of 9-Sep-2017, Baby Step has exceeded [a 2015 gender classifier published at CVPR 2015](http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/cnn_agegender/),with a performance of over 93% accuracy (cutting the error rate by about 50%).
This makes it (as far as I know!) the world's best gender classifier.

However, There's a lot of room for improvement, so i consider Baby Step a work in progress.
